# League of legends - choice of aram champions

Project to choose champions witch are not available in ARAM (All Random All Mid) mode in League of Legends. My account is mostly only-aram and I will prioritize those champions to buy first in order to be able to play them independently from free-to-play champion rotation.

This project is based on web-scraping. I used LoL official site with champions to get all champions names and fandom site to get a table with chamions and their prices.

### Next steps

I would like to acquire information from my account and check how much blue essence I have and what shards are there in my loot.

**Update** Unfortunately after chatting with LoL support, further planned development will not be possible.

*Me:* I am creating a project. I created a table with all champions and their prices and would like to check if I can afford to buy them. To do it I need to dynamically import data from my account (Blue essence and acquired champion shards in my loot). Is it possible to access this information from somewhere after logging in?

*Support:* Hey there. Unfortunately the client doesn't contain other data besides the actual shards from your loot. On our side of things, we also don't have additional data, like a table with your shards along with their BE value. So unfortunately, it would be necessary to write down your shards and their BE value manually.

To sum up, I think this is all for the project right now, unless I have another idea to develop it.
