# League of legends - choice of aram champions

Project to choose champions witch are not available in ARAM (All Random All Mid) mode in League of Legends. My account is mostly only-aram and I will prioritize those champions to buy first in order to be able to play them independently from free-to-play champion rotation.

This project is based on web-scraping. I used LoL official site with champions to get all champions names and fandom site to get a table with chamions and their prices.

### Next steps

I would like to acquire information from my account and check how much blue essence I have and what shards are there in my loot.
